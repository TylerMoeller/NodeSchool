Source Code Repository Access
Notepad++ source code repository is available on GitHub:

https://github.com/donho/notepad-plus-plus.git

Your pull requests will be welcome. However, they are not always accepted for diverse reasons.
Here are the guidelines for your pull requests:

Respect Notepad++ coding style.
Avoid to commit several features in one commit.
Make your modification compact - don't reformat source code in your request. It makes code review more difficult.
In short: The easier the code review is, the better the chance your pull request has to get accepted

 

Notepad++ ECCN
Notepad++ is "Made in Worldwide" and distributed outside of USA territory (both source code and binary) so there shouldn't be ECCN issue. However you may need Notepad++ ECCN number to conforme to US law, here it is:
EAR99

 

Binary Translations
From Binary Translations page you could get the language you need.
Please refer to translate binary howto if you want to get more information.

 

Plugins
From the v3.1, Notepad++ has the extension capacity - the plugin system. Please see Plugins HOWTO to learn how to install a plugin or/and how to develop a plugin.

A list of plugins is maintained on NpWiki++ and should be complete. You can use this list to add/update your plugins, but it may not be necessary - Plugin Manager plugin is included in Notepad++ release. It gets jobs done very well.

If you can not find the plugin you need, just make your own.

 

User Defined Language files
For some reasons that some languages are not supported by Notepad++, User Language Define System can help you out in this case. This system allows user to define his own language : not only the syntax highlighting keywords definition, but also the syntax folding keywords definition, comment keywords definition and the operators definition.

You can define your language via User Language Define Dialog. However, the language you need may be already defined by someone-else in this User Defined Language List.

 

Notepad Replacement
This is one of the most asked question in the forums. A lot of references are pointed in Make Notepad++ the Default TXT Editor page on NpWiki++.
